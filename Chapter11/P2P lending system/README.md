## Step-by-Step Solution:

### 1. Install impartant packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Compile the Contracts:

After making these changes, compile the contracts with the updated compiler version:

```bash
truffle compile
```

This should resolve the `ParserError` related to the Solidity version and ensure that the Chainlink contract can be found.

### 5. Deploy the Contracts :

After successful compilation, you can deploy your contracts as usual:

```bash
truffle migrate --network development
```

By ensuring the correct compiler version and dependencies, you should be able to compile and deploy your contracts without issues.
